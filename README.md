# NYC_Citibike

## Overview of the analysis 

In this analysis, we will convert the datatype of the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datatime datatype. Then, we will use the converted data to create a set of visualization to: 

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders 
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Summary 

- The major type of the users are subscribers, who are most likely the local residents of NYC. Male users are the dominant consumer group for citibike. When it comes to trip by gender, time by gender, and User Trips by Gender by Weekday, the difference between male and female is not significant. Most of the riders's trip duration is less than 20 minutes. The busiest timeframe for citibike during a week is Thursday, from 5 pm to 6 pm. 
 
- To get a clear picture of future major customer group, I created another two visualizations for the most popular destinations in NYC and top 5 popular end stations by gender. The most popular destinations are located in the CBD area of Manhattan. So we can portrait the major user group as a young man who works in central Manhattan and commute to work by metro and bike.
