# NYC_Citibike

## Overview of the analysis 

In this analysis, we will convert the datatype of the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datatime datatype. Then, we will use the converted data to create a set of visualization to: 

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders 
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
